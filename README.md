# U-Net based Lung Segmentation

Lung segmentation is a crucial step in analyzing chest X-ray images for the accurate diagnosis and treatment of lung-related diseases. In this paper, I propose a deep
learning-based approach for lung segmentation in chest X-ray images using the U-Net architecture. The method leverages the power of convolutional neural networks (CNN) and a custom decoder to segment lung regions from X-ray images effectively. I demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach on a dataset of lung X-ray images, achieving high Intersection over Union (IoU) and Dice scores, which indicate the quality of the segmentation results.
